# How to start
**FIRST OPEN SETTINGS.JSON IN THE CONFIG FOLDER AND CHANGE THE SETTINGS, MS.JS EXPLAINS WHAT EACH SETTINGS DOES** open a terminal inside of MCWS-FluffHyena and run *npm i discord.js ws uuid* then run *node ms.js* 
you might be good after this but if you arent look in the newly created folder and format all of the json files by typing {} inside them and runing the server again. 
You should be good after this! If you arent try running the server again and if it still doesnt start you probably messes something up

# Redeem Suff
To add more stuff to redeem copy one of the examples in redeem.json (its in the config folder) and rename it to the name of the tag thatll be able to claim it (only the people with the tag named *test* can do !redeem test) the first thing in the [] is the cooldown (in milliseconds) till you can redeem that again, the items use the last part of the give command so to give 5 pink stained glass to the person who used the redeem command youd put *stained_glass 5 6* in one of the slots, you can add any amount of slots and redeem things

# Codes
(In the config folder and in codes.json) To add more copy the example any command can be used in "cmd(num)". Give commands can be used in "givecmd(num)" make sure you only put the item, 
item amount, and id. Scoreboard commands can be used in "scorecmd(num)" make sure you only put the scoreboard name and a number.
You can have up to 100 of each command type just make sure they have a diffrent number at the end. **Each code needs a set with the name of the code then set 
(examplecodeset)** 

# Warps
(In the config folder in warps.json) To add more warps just copy an example in the warps json and replace the text with the name of your warp and the numbers with the location of your warp

# Custom functions
What is the purpose of custom functions? They let you transfer function between worlds without needing to copy them and add them it behavior packs! To make one create a txt file in the functions folder, the txt files name will be the name of the function in game "function test". These work like normal function files except they can have "/" at the start of commands.

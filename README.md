# How to start
open a terminal inside of MCWS-FluffHyena and run *node ms.js* 
you might be good after this but if you arent look in the newly created folder and format all of the json files by typing {} inside them and runing the server again. 
You should be good after this! If you arent try running the server again and if it still doesnt start you probably messes something up

# Redeem Suff
There are a few things you need to do to get your own kits/ranks setup. first copy the 2 vars around lines 45 and 46 and rename the first one to what you want the text after 
the redeem command to be (!redeem overloard) and edit the loot it gives. The numbers is the cooldown for the kit/rank (it uses Milliseconds) **the loot must be the same name as they are in /give commands**. Then change the name of the set the set must have the name of the first var and set at the end of the name or it wont work. **KEEP IN MIND the name of the var has to match the name of the tag that the user (to redeem the kit/rank named overloard they need to have the tag name overloard)**. Next go to around line 164 and copy everything then rename all the examplekit and examplekitset 's to your vars thats it! ~~sorry this is so complex, I couldnt do it how I did it like codes bc there needed to be a cooldown~~

# Codes
To add more copy the example any command can be used in "cmd(num)". Give commands can be used in "givecmd(num)" make sure you only put the item, 
item amount, and id. Scoreboard commands can be used in "scorecmd(num)" make sure you only put the scoreboard name and a number.
You can have up to 100 of each command type just make sure they have a diffrent number at the end. **Each code needs a set with the name of the code then set 
(examplecodeset)** 

# Custom functions
What is the purpose of custom functions? They let you transfer function between worlds without needing to copy them and add them it behavior packs! To make one create a txt file in the functions folder, the txt files name will be the name of the function in game "function test". These work like normal function files except they can have "/" at the start of commands.
